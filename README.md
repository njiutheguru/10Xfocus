#### 10Xfocus is a hobbyist Python tkinter project featuring a Pomodoro application.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
This Pomodoro application uses a default timer of 25 minutes for workouts, 5-minute breaks, and 20-minute long breaks. The app has 4 workouts before a long break is issued.
The reset button has been employed to reset the whole Pomodoro app. Additionally, the app allows task name customization and default minutes for different sessions.
A lot can be added to the app and a lot can be removed from the app.
A big shout out to [InnoSetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for creating the installation .exe file for window os_x32_x64_x86
Also, it is worth mentioning that the app uses traditional Tkinter widgets.
